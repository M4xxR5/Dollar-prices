# Dollar prices page

This project serves as an example of how to use webpack, babel, react, eslint and prettier to create a web application. The application queries the database of the √Åmbito newspaper and displays the prices of the different types of dollars handled in Argentina. Each type of dollar has its own widget with the updated value and the percentage variation.
